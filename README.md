## [Use MindLog Here](https://therapy-app.fly.dev/)
MindLog is a therapy portal where a patient and provider (medical care provider) can communicate based on the entries and mood of the patient. Each patient's daily logs are only visible to their assigned psycologist/psychiatrist/medical care provider where they can be assested for further treatment such as suggesting daily mood-boosting activities, medication, and more. 

The inspiartion for this type of app comes from my daily digital mind log where I collect my thoughts and describe my mood, which I have shared in verbadme during my therapy sessions over the years. My hope is that such app can be easily accessible to anyone in order to better their mental health and even for suicide prevention.
